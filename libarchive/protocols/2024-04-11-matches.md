Found signed integer overflows which are not worth fixing, yet.

# Timeline

Experimented with archive\_match.c. It is possible to overflow
struct match.matches with an insanely huge archive, which can
be triggered with an mlist input containing 2 billion entries.

But another variable overflows which is exposed through API, so
this was merely a fun experience.
