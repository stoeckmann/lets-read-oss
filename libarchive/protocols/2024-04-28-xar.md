Fixed another endless loop in xar after a "regression" issue.

# Timeline

After 3.7.4 release an issue has been filed stating that a xar test
leads to an endless loop. The reporter was uncertain if my pull request
triggered the issue:
https://github.com/libarchive/libarchive/issues/2146

Turned out that code for expat had an issue, which was able to override
an error return value with a success return value.

During investigation, another loop was detected.

Created a pull request which fixed both issues:
