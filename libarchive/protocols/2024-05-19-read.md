Fixed a bug in EOF handling of read code. Also investigated further
the RAR parser and fixed a bug in 7zip CRC disabling code.

# Timeline

Wrote a patch for EOF handling in reader. I found this before but
did not want to fix it before the previous 7zip findings were fixed.
Restarted reading RAR parser since according to previous findings and
fixes upstream indicates that more issues could be found.
