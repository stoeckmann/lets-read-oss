Created proof of concept for NULL pointer dereference with short
reads. Actually this took more than just one day, but added sum of
all hours to this date.

# Timeline

Noticed a possible mischeck of short reads in 7zip, but it turned out
to be quite difficult to reach it. While finding a way to trigger it,
wrote patches for all issues required to actually get the NULL pointer
dereference working.
