# Let's Read Open Source Software

A Transparent Code Review Process.

Open Source Software is an integral part of today's society, powering
virtually every commonly used device connected to the internet to some
extend. Operating Systems, Browsers, and Servers use a lot of open
source software internally.

The aim of this project is to enable everyone to learn how to access
this sheer endless source of knowledge for personal development and to
be able to identify common coding concepts and avoiding pitfall during
own development.

Documentation of code review processes is made available for later
analysis, as well as write-ups of interesting concepts and findings.
Transparency is key: No crucial step shall be omitted.
